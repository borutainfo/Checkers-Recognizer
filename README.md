# Checkers Recognizer

This project has been created using OpenCV library in Visual Studio 2013 on Windows 7 x64.
I do not export the entire project (only the source file), because you need to configure your 
environment. 

This should help you to install OpenCV:

And this is good OpenCV tutorial: http://opencv-srf.blogspot.com/

This app should look and work as on the screenshots.
